# 05 Victor Moscone's Work Day Scheduler - HW5

## AKA Sticky Notes for your daily prison life.

**A quick description**: Zdravstvuyte, comrade. Have you come to sulk in the woes of your eternal servitude to the man? Perhaps you've forgotten to buy your son a limited-edition figure of Turbo-Man for Christmas? Or maybe you're Neville Longbottom and you need an extra layer of rememberall.

No matter the reason for coming here, know that this app wil help you recall all the various things you need to do during your ever busy day. All you need to do is type in what you want to save and click the nice blue floppy disk icon. This will save your note in that time slot! Each time slot will gray out as they fall into the past, while the current hour will be highlighted in red.

Is it a new day? No worries! You can refresh all of your saved timeslots by clicking the "Reset your day!" button.

I'm pretty proud of how I setup this code. It's fairly scalable although there's one major change that could improve the code.
1. Allow the user to dictate how many hours they'd like to view. This is saved to local machine.
2. Instead of manually creating each row in the HTML, you could have a function that populates each row based on the selection from the above idea.
3. Google Calender integration, because you're not official until you have one.
